 * This method is invoked from a recognition internal thread. To perform UI work, you must dispatch to the main thread first. After receiving this callback, you will typically want to start processing the scanned barcodes. Keep in mind however, that any further recognition is blocked until this method completes. Therefore, if you need to perform a time-consuming operation, like querying a database or opening an URL encoded in the barcode data, consider switching to another thread.
 *
 * Sometimes, after receiving this callback, you may want to stop scanning. You can do that by disabling the SparkScan.
