Use this property to change the interval or completely turn off duplicate filtering:

 *   • Setting this property to a value larger than zero indicates the time that must pass between the same code to be reported again.
 *
 * The filtering is reset any time the capture mode is disabled (SDCDataCaptureMode.enabled is set to false) as this is when the session is cleaned and restarts from zero.
