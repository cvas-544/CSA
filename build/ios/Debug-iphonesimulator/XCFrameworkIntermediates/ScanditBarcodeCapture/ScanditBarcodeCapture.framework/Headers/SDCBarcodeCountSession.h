/**
 * Added in version 6.14.0

 * The count session contains all the currently tracked barcodes and changes that were made specifically in the last processed frame.
 *
 * The count session should only be accessed from within barcodeCount:didScanInSession:frameData: to which it is provided as an argument. It is not safe to be accessed from anywhere else since it may be concurrently modified.
 *
 * Specifically no reference to recognizedBarcodes should be kept and traversed outside of barcodeCount:didScanInSession:frameData:. Instead a copy of the lists should be made to avoid concurrent modification. The individual tracked barcodes can be referenced without copying as they are not further modified.
